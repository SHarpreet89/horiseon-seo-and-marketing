# Horiseon Marketing Website Code Refactor

## Description

This project involved refactoring the codebase for Horiseon, a fictional marketing company. The primary goal was to improve the website's accessibility and enhance its Search Engine Optimization (SEO). 

## User Story

As a marketing agency, we wanted a codebase that adheres to accessibility standards, ensuring our site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The title element has been corrected.
- Semantic HTML has been implemented. Instead of using generic `div` tags, the HTML now uses semantic tags, making it easier for search engines to read and understand the content structure.
- All images include alt text, improving accessibility for screen readers.
- CSS properties have been consolidated and excess code has been reduced. The CSS classes and tags are now better organized, reflecting their hierarchy in the HTML structure.
- Broken HTML links have been fixed, ensuring all navigation is functional.
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, enhancing readability and understanding of the codebase.
- Alt text has been provided for all images, improving accessibility for visually impaired users and enhancing SEO.
- Unnecessary CSS classes have been removed or consolidated, reducing code redundancy and improving load times.
